# PipeSystemCalculator
The excel file was made during my intern with Purdue University Physical Facilities for calculating pressured pipe system pressure.

The initial situation is to figure out if the pump head for black waste of Gatewood wing of ME building. And I expanded this to be a more general and detailed calculator.

And since this is a old version based on excel, I am planning to transfer it to python based app.

And consider to make it availiable on my personal blog website.
